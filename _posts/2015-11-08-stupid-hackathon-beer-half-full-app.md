In November I participated in the [Stupid Hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.at). If you are not aware of the concept, please read up on these links:

* [stupidhackathon.de](http://stupidhackathon.de)

Basically it's a hackathon for stupid and useless ideas. The whole thing is just for fun.

## Ideas
The event started with brainstorming stupid and useless ideas.

So we decided on developing an app that tells you how much beer is left in your glass.

The app is called *halffull* and utilizes break-through technology to do all kinds of beer related stuff. You can place your beer on the phone and it will tell you how full your glass is.
